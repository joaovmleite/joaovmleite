## Hello!

As a Full-Stack Engineer with a strong focus on delivering efficient, high-impact solutions, I have turned my lifelong passion for technology into a results-driven career. Specializing in React and Node.js, I design and build complex, scalable applications, crafting robust APIs and dynamic user interfaces.

I led the development of Evonauta, a school-management platform built with React and Vite, where I implemented comprehensive automated testing using Vitest and Testing Library. I also create lightweight, high-performance applications with pure JavaScript and serverless functions that orchestrate data from external APIs.

Additionally, I developed Areajobs.co, a job board web application inspired by a technical challenge from Trampos.co. The project, built with React and Vite, focuses on listing, searching, filtering, and creating job vacancies. I used the Context API to manage the global state of the vacancies, ensuring a clear and easily maintainable solution. The application features a new job creation form that includes validation for mandatory fields and sanitization to prevent XSS (Cross-site Scripting). The project was also designed to be responsive, with a clean and modern layout.

My development approach prioritizes code quality, scalability, and an exceptional user experience, ensuring that every product I deliver meets the highest standards.
