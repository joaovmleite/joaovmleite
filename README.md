## Hello!

As a Full‑Stack Engineer with a strong focus on delivering efficient, high‑impact solutions, I have turned my lifelong passion for technology into a results‑driven career. Specializing in React and Node.js, I design and build complex, scalable applications, crafting robust APIs and dynamic user interfaces.

I led the development of Evonauta, a school‑management platform built with React and Vite, where I implemented comprehensive automated testing using Vitest and Testing Library. I also create lightweight, high‑performance applications with pure JavaScript and serverless functions that orchestrate data from external APIs.

My development approach prioritizes code quality, scalability, and an exceptional user experience, ensuring that every product I deliver meets the highest standards.
